## Overview

This project implements the **Yee algorithm** for solving Maxwell's curl equations on a staggered grid. The FDTD method discretizes both space and time, updating electric and magnetic fields in a leapfrog scheme that naturally satisfies Faraday's and Ampère's laws.

### Maxwell's Equations (Vacuum)

The solver implements the two curl equations:

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t} = -\nabla \times \mathbf{E}$$

$$\frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} = c^2 \nabla \times \mathbf{B}$$

### CFL Stability Condition

The time step is automatically calculated to satisfy the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition:

$$\Delta t = \frac{0.99}{c \sqrt{\frac{1}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta y^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta z^2}}}$$

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- C++17 compiler (GCC recommended)
- OpenMP support
- Python 3.x with NumPy and Plotly

### Build & Run

```bash
# Compile with OpenMP (recommended)
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main.exe -fopenmp
```

### Without OpenMP

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o main.exe
```

### Grid Constructor Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `Nx, Ny, Nz` | Grid dimensions | 10 |
| `dx, dy, dz` | Spatial step sizes | 1.0 |
| `c` | Speed of light | 1.0 |

## Visualization

The included Python script generates an interactive 3D animation of the Ez field evolution:

```python
python render.py
```

## Theory

### Yee Algorithm

The Yee scheme staggers E and B fields both spatially and temporally:

1. **B-field update** (half time step): Uses E-field curl at current positions
2. **E-field update** (full time step): Uses B-field curl at offset positions

This leapfrog integration preserves the divergence-free nature of the magnetic field and maintains second-order accuracy in both space and time.

### Boundary Conditions

Currently implements **absorbing boundaries** at grid edges (fields decay at boundaries). The update loops exclude boundary cells to prevent out-of-bounds access.

## Performance

*Results vary by hardware. The `collapse(2)` and `simd` pragmas optimize the nested loops for parallel execution.*
